Preregistration training aims to help researchers make their results more trustworthy by clearly differentiating pre-planned from exploratory analyses.

This training will teach researchers to:
* preregister studies and write Registered Reports (in which a journal prospectively agrees to publish a study on the basis of its methodology before the results are know)
* **find repositories**
* identify **what type of studies** preregistration is most valuable for
* choose an appropriate preregistration **template**
* locate **journals which accept Registered Reports**

_Preregistration training introduces you to the fundamentals of preregistration and
provides you with practical tools for preregistering real studies. It also acts as a
platform for further self-directed learning.
