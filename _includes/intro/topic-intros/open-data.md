Open Data training aims to help researchers make their data available to others so that their results can be checked and the data reused for other purposes.

This training will teach researchers to:
* produce data which are **FAIR**: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable
* **find repositories**
* use appropriate **data formats**
* manage **metadata** (information describing datasets)
* ensure **non-identifiability** (for researchers working with human data)

_Open Data training introduces you to the fundamentals of data sharing and
provides you with practical tools for sharing real data. It also acts as a
platform for further self-directed learning.
