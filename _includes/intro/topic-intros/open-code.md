Open Code training helps researchers share software so that others can check their results and extend their work.

This training will teach researchers to:
* use **version control** to transparently track the evolution of software and analysis scripts
* **licence software appropriately** and **publish** code on public platforms
* use **good programming habits** to create code that can be read, used, and extended by others
* use **literate programming** tools to embed analysis code and its results directly into manuscripts

_Open Code training introduces you to the fundamentals of writing and sharing good code, and
provides you with practical tools for sharing actual code. It also acts as a
platform for further self-directed learning.
