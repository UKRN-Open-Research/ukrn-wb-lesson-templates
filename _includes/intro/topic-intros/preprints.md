Training on preprints helps researchers disseminate their research more rapidly and widely using preprint archives.

This training will teach researchers to:
* **find archives**
* understand how **preprinting changes the journal publication workflow**
* identify **when **to publish a preprint
* **publish an article** as a preprint
* understand issues surrounding the **interpretation of preprints** by non-expert readers

_Training on preprints introduces you to the fundamentals of preprinting and
provides you with practical tools for preprinting actual manuscripts. It also acts as a
platform for further self-directed learning.
