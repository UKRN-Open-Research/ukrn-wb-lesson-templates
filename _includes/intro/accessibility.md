### Accessibility

We are committed to making this workshop accessible to everybody. The workshop organizers have checked that:

* The room is wheelchair / scooter accessible.
* Accessible restrooms are available.

Materials will be provided in advance of the workshop and
  large-print handouts are available if needed by notifying the
  organizers in advance.
If we can help making learning easier for
  you (e.g. sign-language interpreters, lactation facilities) please
  get in touch (using contact details below) and we will
  attempt to provide them.

We are dedicated to providing a positive and accessible learning environment for all.
Please notify the instructors in advance of the workshop if you require any accommodations or if there is anything we can do to make this workshop more accessible to you.
