  <h3>Git</h3>
  <p>
    Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes
    to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public
    version of your code
    on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. You will need a
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/">supported
    web browser</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    You will need an account at <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>
    for parts of the Git lesson. Basic GitHub accounts are free. We encourage
    you to create a GitHub account if you don't have one already.
    Please consider what personal information you'd like to reveal. For
    example, you may want to review these
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/">instructions
      for keeping your email address private</a> provided at GitHub.

                On the page that says "Adjusting the name of the initial branch in new repositories", ensure that
                "Let Git decide" is selected. This will ensure the highest level of compatibility for our lessons.
                {% comment %}
                This section also has "Override the default branch name for new repositories" and has a text box set
                to "main". I'm not having people switch to this just yet because our git lesson still uses the old paradigm.

          <strong>For macOS</strong>, install Git for Mac
          by downloading and running the most recent "mavericks" installer from
          <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">this list</a>.
          Because this installer is not signed by the developer, you may have to
          right click (control click) on the .pkg file, click Open, and click
          Open on the pop up window.
          After installing Git, there will not be anything in your <code>/Applications</code> folder,
          as Git is a command line program.
          <strong>For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.8)</strong> use the
          most recent available installer labelled "snow-leopard"
          <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">available here</a>.

          If Git is not already available on your machine you can try to
          install it via your distro's package manager. For Debian/Ubuntu run
          <code>sudo apt-get install git</code> and for Fedora run
          <code>sudo dnf install git</code>.
